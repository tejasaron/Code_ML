Project Scope 

✔ Primary ML Task (Regression):

Predict short-term load (kW) for the next 1 hour and 24 hours, using:

Voltage

Current

Active power

Reactive power

Solar generation

Wind generation

Grid import

Environmental factors (Temp, Humidity, Electricity price)

✔ Secondary ML Task (Classification):

Fault Detection (overload, transformer faults, abnormal voltage/current).


1.2 Exact Target Variable

✔ Predicted_Load_kW

You will predict:

Next 1 timestep (15-min ahead)

Next 4 timesteps (1 hour ahead)

Next 96 timesteps (24 hours ahead)

These become:

t+1

t+4

t+96

The pipeline to support multi-horizon forecasting.

1.3 Define Success Criteria (Industry Standard)

✔ Predictive Performance
Horizon	Business Goal	ML Metric Goal
15-min ahead	Real-time load control	MAE < 0.25 kW
1-hour ahead	Demand response	MAE < 0.35 kW
24-hour ahead	Day-ahead scheduling	MAE < 0.60 kW

✔ Fault Detection

Accuracy > 90%

F1-score > 0.85 (important for imbalance)

✔ Baseline Models (MUST compare):

Persistence Model: load_t+1 = load_t

Seasonal Average: same hour/day-of-week average

Linear Model: simple linear regression
You must beat these to prove ML value.
